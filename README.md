**Presidential Election Data Explorer**

This project is a command-line application designed to explore, analyze, and visualize presidential election data efficiently. Built using C++, it combines the power of basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with functional programming techniques to provide users with a user-friendly and interactive experience.

**Key Features**
- Search for election results by candidate name (e.g., vote tally, best-performing states).
- Explore election data sorted by states, counties, and candidates.
- Calculate and display vote percentages for each candidate across states.
- Intuitive handling of large datasets using text file input/output.
- User-friendly menu navigation with color-coded outputs for enhanced readability.
  
**Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: C++
- Concepts: Basic OOP (Classes, Functions), File Handling, ANSI Escape Codes for colored outputs.
  
**How It Works**
- Input election data from a .txt file.
- Select from six different analysis options to view and process results.
- Enjoy clear, color-coded outputs that make data insights stand out.
  
**Future Improvements**
- Add support for additional data formats (e.g., CSV).
- Implement more advanced sorting and filtering options.
- Expand visualizations to include graphs and charts via third-party libraries.
